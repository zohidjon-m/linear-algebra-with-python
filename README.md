# Linear Algebra with Python

This repository contains my linear algebra exercises and implementations 
from Sejong Universityâ€™s Linear Algebra course.  
I use Python to implement the theory we learn in class.

## Contents
- Theory notes (markdown files)
- Python scripts implementing concepts
- Jupyter notebooks with visualizations
- Mini projects connecting linear algebra to real-world problems

## Example Topics
- Vector operations
- Matrix operations
- Determinants & Inverses
- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- Applications (e.g., Linear Regression, PCA)
